While state governments do their best within their capacities, the expertise, resources, and coordination required to manage large-scale disasters effectively are often beyond their reach.</p>\n<br>\n<p>It is also noteworthy that ordinary citizens, despite being ill-equipped and untrained, have played crucial roles in rescue and relief efforts during disasters.

The responsibility for ensuring national preparedness to face disaster situations must lie with the Central Government, which has the requisite expertise, infrastructure, and financial resources to manage such crises effectively.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We therefore urge the Union Government to consider bringing disaster management fully under its jurisdiction. This system should include the deployment of highly trained personnel, with experts drawn from the armed forces and other relevant agencies.

      "title": "Is Lok Sabha Constituency Delimitation Necessary?",
      "shortDescription": "A view on delimitation process of Loksabha constituencies  that Government of India plans ",
      "longDescription": "<h2 class=\"title-pink text-decoration-underline\">Is Lok Sabha Constituency Delimitation Necessary?</h2>\n<p>Is Lok Sabha Constituency Delimitation Necessary?\n-\tV.R.Ajith kumar ,President, People for Better Society \n</p>\n<br>\n<p>On March 5, 2025, at a meeting of political parties convened by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in Chennai, all 59 political party representatives who attended the meeting unanimously demanded that the Central Government should not attempt delimitation based on the 2011 Census.</p>\n<br>\n<p>The current 543 Lok Sabha seats have been determined based on the 1971 Census. Tamil Nadu is unanimously demanding that this should continue for the next thirty years. The state has also demanded a constitutional amendment for this purpose through a resolution. Leaders believe that if the delimitation of constituencies is done based on the existing population, it will unjustly punish the states that have excelled in population control and progressive governance, particularly the southern states, for their positive achievements.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Delimitation of constituencies has been carried out in 1952, 1962, 1972, and 2002.In 1952, there were 489 seats. In 1962, it was increased to 494, and in 1972, to 522. In 1976, when it was decided not to increase the number of members for twenty-five years through the Forty-second Constitutional Amendment, the total number of members was fixed at 543. This continues to be the case today.</p>\n<br>\n<p>The progressive decision taken in 1976 to not increase the number of representatives in proportion to the population was aimed at encouraging population control. This position was reaffirmed through the Eighty-fourth Constitutional Amendment in 2001, which extended the decision to maintain the current number of representatives until 2026. Even now, there is no compelling reason to alter this arrangement. As demanded by Tamil Nadu, the number of members should be maintained without change until 2056, or the current total of 543 members should be fixed permanently.</p>\n<br>\n<p>At present, one Lok Sabha member represents an average of 10 to 11 lakh people. If delimitation is conducted based on population, the number of Lok Sabha seats in Kerala will drop from 20 to 12, in Tamil Nadu from 39 to 31, and in Karnataka from 28 to 26. Conversely, states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan would see a significant increase in their representation.</p>\n<br>\n<p>If population is made the criterion for re-delimitation, the primary beneficiaries would be politicians from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, as 26% of India's 1.4 billion population resides in these underdeveloped states. The NDA government, which seeks to strengthen its position in these states, may push for an increase in the total number of Lok Sabha seats to 800 or more, conveniently accommodating this change in the newly constructed Parliament building, which has 888 seats. Consequently, the numerical strength of South India in the House would shrink to 19%, while that of North India would rise to 60%. This imbalance could intensify ideological conflicts between the Central Government and the South Indian state governments. It is essential to foresee that this may lead to severe separatist tendencies.</p>\n<br>\n<p>The primary objective of the Houses of Representatives is to enact legislation through adequate deliberations and ensure governments govern honestly and fairly in a manner that benefits all sections of the people. It is also their responsibility to acknowledge what is right and criticize what is wrong. However, our current Houses of Representatives are failing in this regard. Instead of serious discussions, we often witness fights, shouting, protests, and walkouts. Meaningful discussions about the problems of the common man have become rare. Increasing the number of representatives will not alleviate unemployment or hunger in the country. There is no evidence to suggest improvements in sectors such as education, health, infrastructure development, or women's empowerment. The only noticeable outcome may be reduced unemployment among politicians!</p>\n<br>\n<p>We must unequivocally state that public tax money should not be wasted on this. Each new representative would cost crores of rupees annually without providing any significant benefit. If there is any way to reduce the overcrowding seen in the Houses now, we should pursue that instead. Large crowds seldom contribute constructively.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We should adopt a strategy that does not foster mistrust between people based on development levels, regional disparities, or urban-rural divides. In the United States, the House of Representatives has been fixed at 435 since 1929 through the Permanent Apportionment Act. After each decennial census, these 435 seats are redistributed among states based on population changes. This model suits a developed country where population trends are more stable than in India. Therefore, India can choose to maintain the status quo rather than opt for redistribution.</p>\n<br>\n<p>In the United Kingdom, the number of Members of Parliament in the House of Commons is not fixed and can be adjusted based on recommendations from independent Boundary Commissions. These reviews typically occur every 8 to 12 years to ensure each constituency has roughly the same number of eligible voters (within ±5% of the electoral quota). The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 aimed to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600, though this was later reversed. The 2023 Boundary Review recommended maintaining the current number of MPs while adjusting constituency boundaries to reflect population shifts. Similar adjustments in India may disturb the present political stability.</p>\n<br>\n<p>In conclusion, it would be appropriate to decide that the number of representatives in all legislative bodies, including the Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha, Legislative Assemblies, and Local Self-Government Institutions, should remain at current levels. The Parliament can enact the necessary amendments to settle this issue permanently.</p>\n<br>",
